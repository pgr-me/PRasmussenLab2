# Peter Rasmussen, Lab 2

This ```README``` serves as an informational entry point into the Python module lab2.

## Lab Structure

* ```lab2/```: Python module that recursively converts prefix expressions to postfix ones.
    * Please note this module includes its own ```README``` which explains how to run the Python
      module, features of the module, inputs and outputs, example output file, and licensing.
* ```analysis/```: Word and PDF versions of an analysis of various aspects of the Python module.
* ```resources/```: Required and additional prefix inputs and postfix outputs plus a
  complexity_summary Excel workbook.

## Note

* In an email, Dr. Cost indicated I could use the primitive Python list and its functionality as
  part of the recursive solution.
* For reference, a PDF of this email is provided in the ```resources``` directory.
